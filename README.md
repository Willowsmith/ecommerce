## Description

This is an internet retail e-commerce site that I finished by using Express.js API which I then utilized Sequlize to interact with MySQL in order to make use of databases.

## Usage

Follow the link and use routes like "api/tags" and "api/products" to view the different routes. You can create, update, and delete data in this app as it uses CRUD.
